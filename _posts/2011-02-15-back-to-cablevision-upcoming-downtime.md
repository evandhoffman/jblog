So the credits are finally wearing off my FiOS bill. I was paying $49/month for about 8 straight months for all 3 services plus HBO &#038; Cinemax (a ridiculous price) with great phone &#038; internet, plus HMDVR and 2 boxes. My most recent bill was $127 which includes a $40 credit that ends this month, so next month&#8217;s bill will be $170 or so.

Cablevision&#8217;s been beating down my door for weeks to come back, but they couldn&#8217;t come close to the deal Verizon had given me so it was easy to fend them off. But after this recent bill I gave them a call and signed up for the Optimum Triple Play. They have a special deal for people coming back from FiOS: $69/month for all 3 services plus Boost (30/5 Mbps) and a DVR. I added another box and HBO and it came to $100.30. So as of Friday I&#8217;ll be on Cablevision and this website will probably be down until I find a new home for it &#8211; maybe WordPress.com.
