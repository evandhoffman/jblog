It&#8217;s time to buy some more disks for the SAN we have at work. The SAN is made by <a href="http://www.compellent.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.compellent.com/', 'Compellent']);" >Compellent</a> and we&#8217;ve had it for a year and it&#8217;s been great. One of the selling points was the ability to add disks however we wanted &#8211; one at a time is possible, which apparently isn&#8217;t the case with other SAN products. The one we looked at from LeftHand expanded by purchasing entire nodes, so the incremental cost was pretty high. Compellent seemed to have a higher initial cost but cheaper incrementally.

Well, that wasn&#8217;t really the case, as I&#8217;ve come to discover. The way they license features on the SAN requires &#8220;expansion licenses&#8221; for each set of 8 disks you add on. As it happens, I would like to add 8 SATA disks to our SAN, bumping us into a license expansion. The net result of this is that purchasing these disks costs over $16,000.

If that sounds like a lot of money, well, it is. I expected some markup for enterprise-class hardware, but this is ridiculous. A quick <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=Property&#038;Subcategory=14&#038;Description=&#038;Type=&#038;N=2010150014+103530090&#038;srchInDesc=&#038;MinPrice=&#038;MaxPrice=&#038;OEMMark=1&#038;OEMMark=0&#038;PropertyCodeValue=359%3A15133&#038;PropertyCodeValue=353%3A13496&#038;PropertyCodeValue=353%3A20984&#038;PropertyCodeValue=355%3A7821&#038;PropertyCodeValue=355%3A7776&#038;PropertyCodeValue=355%3A7779" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=Property&Subcategory=14&Description=&Type=&N=2010150014+103530090&srchInDesc=&MinPrice=&MaxPrice=&OEMMark=1&OEMMark=0&PropertyCodeValue=359%3A15133&PropertyCodeValue=353%3A13496&PropertyCodeValue=353%3A20984&PropertyCodeValue=355%3A7821&PropertyCodeValue=355%3A7776&PropertyCodeValue=355%3A7779', 'search on Newegg']);" >search on Newegg</a> shows that hard drives are readily available at about $0.09 &#8211; $0.10 per gigabyte, and even Seagate drives are only around $0.14 per gig. At the price I was quoted for the Compellent drives, the price per gig is **over $2.00 per gig!** The markup is over 1500%, and that&#8217;s not even factoring in the discount they likely get for buying disks in bulk &#8211; I doubt they pay retail. They claim this is due to the disks being &#8220;certified&#8221; but I don&#8217;t imagine they&#8217;re opening up each disk and checking its platters. They probably just make sure the firmware is correct and then ship it out. Their quote also includes 1 year of support on the disks, with 4-hour on-site replacement, but still, as someone who&#8217;s basically &#8220;cheap,&#8221; this just pisses me off.

Now, in Compellent&#8217;s defense, their product is amazing, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with the need for it and the means to get it, but it is very pricey, moreso than I was led to believe. The fact that I rarely have to think about the SAN probably means it&#8217;s money well spent, but as I said, I&#8217;m a cheap bastard, so this bothers me.
