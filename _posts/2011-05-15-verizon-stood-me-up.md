Several weeks ago, I scheduled the FiOS install for 5/14/2011 and they said it would be between 8am and 5pm. I got confirmation emails (welcome to FiOS) and a confirmation call on 5/12. I waited all day yesterday for Verizon to show, and they never did. I called at 11:58 AM and gave my order number to see if they could tell me roughly what time the tech would be here, since I didn&#8217;t want to sit around all day if the tech wouldn&#8217;t be there until 4 PM. They couldn&#8217;t. They said we were still scheduled for today, between 8 and 5. I asked if they could call the tech scheduled to do the installation and see when he thought he&#8217;d get here and I was told they couldn&#8217;t. 

At 5:45 we called Verizon to find out what happened, why the tech didn&#8217;t show, since we&#8217;d waited around the house all day. They told us the order had been put on hold 2 days before because Cablevision wouldn&#8217;t release our phone number. I understand things happen, but not calling to let me know, and then giving me incorrect info when I called, is inexcusable. The Verizon rep we spoke to afterwards wasn&#8217;t even apologetic. Disappointing.
