Time to expand the SAN again.  
<!--more-->

I planned and budgeted for this this year but it still pisses me off. Look, I realize these guys have to make money, but the bottom line is they&#8217;re charging over $1.40/GB for SATA storage. There are 7200 RPM 2TB SATA drives on <a href="http://amzn.com/B002D5DWZU?tag=evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://amzn.com/B002D5DWZU?tag=evanhoffmasho-20', 'Amazon']);" >Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145298" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145298', 'Newegg']);" >Newegg</a> ranging in price from $130 to $220. That&#8217;s as low as $0.065/GB. There was even a 2TB WD &#8220;Green&#8221; drive (sub-7200 RPM, I think 5900 RPM) <a href="http://slickdeals.net/permadeal/38317" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slickdeals.net/permadeal/38317', 'on Slickdeals']);" >on Slickdeals</a> today for $99. That&#8217;s 5 cents per gig.

Like I said, I realize these guys are running a business and they want to make money, but this type of price gouging is just infuriating. Assuming a 2TB SATA disk retails for $200, and they tack on 100% markup, so $6400 for 16 disks. $5000 for the enclosure. $10,000 for their &#8220;special sauce.&#8221; That&#8217;s about $21,000 for 32TB, or $0.65/GB, which is still about a pretty healthy profit. This doesn&#8217;t take into account the insane annual support contracts you&#8217;re paying for in perpetuity.

I don&#8217;t know. I guess I&#8217;m just cheap. I&#8217;ve complained about this before, and I complained about it again this time to our reseller. The SAN vendor is Compellent, and while the product is very good, the pricing certainly doesn&#8217;t scale the way they made it sound during the sales pitch. They kept saying how they&#8217;re able to leverage commodity hardware in order to keep costs low. Well, maybe they meant their own costs. It&#8217;s certainly not getting passed on to us.

Though maybe I&#8217;m jaded because this is the first SAN I&#8217;ve worked with. I&#8217;ve heard lots of horror stories about SANs and carving luns and having to restripe arrays and worrying about hot disks, etc. With Compellent I don&#8217;t have to worry about any of that. It is a nice product. I just wish it was cheaper. My reseller&#8217;s response to my complaint was basically &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely expensive, but at least it&#8217;s good; all SAN vendors mark up their prices wildly but the product often sucks.&#8221;

Anyway, I guess when you have <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:CML" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:CML', 'shareholders']);" >shareholders</a> to please, if you can milk people, you&#8217;d better do it. I suppose my advice would be to buy what you need up front and don&#8217;t expect to be able to leverage falling costs of storage. The savings don&#8217;t get passed on to you.
