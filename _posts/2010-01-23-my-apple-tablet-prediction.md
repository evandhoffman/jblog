I know nobody cares, but I figured I&#8217;d hop on the hypewagon and write down my guess for the Apple tablet. I think a &#8220;big iPod Touch&#8221; would be pretty boring, and not worth making. My guess (based on nothing): the unit will be controlled by eye tracking, and it&#8217;ll be able to zoom in on whatever you&#8217;re looking at.

That is all.
