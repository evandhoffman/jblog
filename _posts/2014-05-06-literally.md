When I was in fifth grade, we had a student teacher in English. I&#8217;ll call her Mrs. N. I guess we were doing a lesson on literal versus figurative speech at some point that year and Mrs. N taught it. On the test at the end of the unit, there was a question to the effect of &#8220;What does the sentence &#8216;It&#8217;s raining cats and dogs?&#8217; mean literally?&#8221; Now, I could tell that she really wanted to know what it meant figuratively, but that&#8217;s not what she asked, so I answered the question with &#8220;Cats and dogs are falling from the sky.&#8221;

After she&#8217;d graded them she returned them and I saw that she marked my answer wrong, with a comment that &#8220;the question was confusing.&#8221; I went up to her and pled my case &#8211; everybody else in the class answered the question she&#8217;d meant to ask, but I answered the question she actually asked. Figuratively, that sentence means &#8220;it&#8217;s raining very hard.&#8221; Therefore, the literal meaning is just what I wrote, and my answer shouldn&#8217;t have been marked wrong. I appealed to the real teacher and she told Mrs. N that I was correct.

I bring this up because the meaning word &#8220;literally&#8221; appears to have been eroded in recent years to the point where &#8220;literally&#8221; is no longer the literal definition of literal. I was reminded of this today when I read <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/lara-logan-cbs-news-2014-5/index5.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nymag.com/news/features/lara-logan-cbs-news-2014-5/index5.html', 'this story']);" >this story</a> about Lara Logan:

As another data point, if you now look up the word <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=literally" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/search?q=literally', 'literally']);" >literally</a> in Google, it shows you a definition that includes the words &#8220;used for emphasis or to express strong feeling while not being literally true.&#8221; Yes, Google&#8217;s official definition indicates that &#8220;literally&#8221; means &#8220;not literally.&#8221;

This is just one of the many infractions I see on a daily basis that burn my retinas (another being &#8216;irregardless&#8217;).
