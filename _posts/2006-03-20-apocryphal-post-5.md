I changed hosting providers. I was with OLM.net for a long time, but BlueHost.com seemed to provide better/more features for less money, so I made the decision and left. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff going on as usual, but if you don&#8217;t know about it already then you probably don&#8217;t care anyway!
