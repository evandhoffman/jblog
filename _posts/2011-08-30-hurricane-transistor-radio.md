With hurricane Irene passing through this past weekend I quickly shopped for an AM/FM radio. I found this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-ICF-S10MK2-Pocket-Radio-Silver/dp/B00020S7XK/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;tag=evanhoffmasho-20&#038;qid=1314389265&#038;sr=1-1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Sony-ICF-S10MK2-Pocket-Radio-Silver/dp/B00020S7XK/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&tag=evanhoffmasho-20&qid=1314389265&sr=1-1', 'Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio']);" >Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio</a>. Cheap, runs on 2 AA batteries, and worked great. A++, would buy again. I actually bought 2, one for my mom. I ordered them on Friday and paid the $8 to bump each one up to overnight with Prime, and they were both delivered Saturday morning. Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t home to receive it, and the package weathered the storm on my front step.

Times like these you learn the real value of low-tech. iPhone, useless. The only way of getting information was this wonderful $10 AM/FM radio. Thanks Sony and <a href="http://www.wlng.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wlng.com/', 'WLNG']);" >WLNG</a>!
