I&#8217;d almost forgotten that I hate computers. Then I came home from Memorial Day weekend and woke my desktop up from Sleep in order to extract the pics I&#8217;d taken. The computer looked ok for about 15 seconds, then kind of froze. The cursor would move but it didn&#8217;t do anything. I watched it do (apparently) nothing for about 2 minutes when I hit the hard-reboot button. It hung at POST with the HDD light on solid. I couldn&#8217;t get into the BIOS, so I tried plugging into a different SATA port on the mobo, and finally got the thing to post by &#8230; unplugging the drive completely. I got into the bios, did a &#8220;load failsafe defaults&#8221; and tried plugging the drive back in and booting. It made it through POST this time but gave me the &#8220;INSERT SYSTEM DISK&#8221; error. After about an hour of messing around with it I turned it off and came upstairs to go to bed. The drive is a Seagate Barracuda 7200.11, 1000 GB, purchased less than 18 months ago (Christmas 2008). I know things die, but this is just dumb. Maybe tomorrow I&#8217;ll see if anything shows up using a USB-to-SATA adapter. Sigh.
