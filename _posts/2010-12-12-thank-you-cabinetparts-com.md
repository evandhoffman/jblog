A couple of weeks ago the hinge on one of the cabinets in our kitchen broke. I took the door off, unscrewed the hinge, and went to Home Depot to try and find a replacement. No luck. I went to a local hardware store, same deal. I was annoyed, and worried I&#8217;d never be able to find a replacement. I headed home.

I looked at the broken hinge and found imprinted on it, in tiny numerals, was &#8220;32.260-01&#8243;. It also had &#8220;blum&#8221; imprinted on it, which I assumed was the brand name. A long shot, but I entered &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blum+32.260-01&#038;hl=en" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?q=blum+32.260-01&hl=en', 'blum 32.260-01']);" >blum 32.260-01</a>&#8221; in Google. I was thrilled to see that while there were no organic results, there was a paid link for CabinetParts.com. I clicked through and found <a href="http://www.cabinetparts.com/p/blum-european-cabinet-hinges-BH333600/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cabinetparts.com/p/blum-european-cabinet-hinges-BH333600/', 'the exact part I needed']);" >the exact part I needed</a>. They were a little more than I&#8217;d hoped to spend, but since I had no idea where else I could go to find them, I was happy to pay it. I got the part a few days later and it was exactly what I needed. Cabinet: repaired. So, hooray for them!
