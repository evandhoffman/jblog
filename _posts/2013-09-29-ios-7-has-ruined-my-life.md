I was looking forward to iOS 7 for a few reasons. I was glad to be rid of the skeumorphic design elements (stupid shit like the &#8220;Notes&#8221; app looking like a yellow notepad) but also glad to get the Control Center to turn off Wifi more easily &#8211; I only need Wifi to be on when I&#8217;m in my house or my office. It&#8217;s just a battery drain elsewhere. Ideally iPhone would just do this via geofencing, and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t is beyond retarded.

So I upgraded the night it was released. Two days later the novelty had worn off. I tried to roll back to iOS 5 (I never upgraded to 6 due to Maps). Failed with error 3194. I tried DFU mode. Failed with error 3194. I was stuck. They released 7.0.2 this past Friday or Saturday night and I hoped it would solve my problems but it didn&#8217;t. Here&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s happened:

  * Battery life is gone. I lose about 1% per minute at times, even with just 1-2 apps running and the phone in **airplane mode**. To go from 100% to 75% usually takes about 90 minutes. 
      * Phone doesn&#8217;t show up on computer at all &#8211; not in iTunes, not as a camera, nothing. I&#8217;ve reinstalled iTunes several times. 
          * It doesn&#8217;t check email any more. It tells me no new messages even when I login to Exchange and see new messages. Same for Gmail. 
              * Audio is broken. The hardware toggle switch appears to be ignored randomly &#8211; it won&#8217;t make sound at times, and then other times makes tons of sound. On the train, when I unplugged my headphones while listening to a song, it kept playing the audio out the loudspeaker and the volume buttons were ignored. 
                  * The phone randomly powers off when it gets under 30% battery life. The behavior is what I used to see when it got around 3%, but now it happens at 30% or so. When I turn it back on, it says there&#8217;s ~25% left so I don&#8217;t know why it shut down. 
                      * iCloud backup does not work. It gets to &#8220;1% remaining&#8221; or something and then says &#8220;iCloud backup failed.&#8221; The last successful one was from the day I last ran iOS 5. </ul> 
                        As of this moment, as I write this, my phone is completely wiped and I&#8217;m attempting to restore it from backup. But the phone won&#8217;t show up in iTunes for me to restore it. Last time  
                        I went to the Apple Store in Grand Central the &#8220;genius&#8221; was useless, told me my phone was fine even though it was barely getting 8 hours battery life with no use &#8211; his advice was to power the phone off at night. It&#8217;s a 4S so not sure what recourse I have, it&#8217;s definitely not under warranty anymore. I have work tomorrow and as of right now a useless phone.
                        
                        I guess my point is, don&#8217;t upgrade to iOS 7 if you have an iPhone 4S.

I took my phone back to the Apple Store and they essentially confirmed that my phone was broken somehow &#8211; it wouldn&#8217;t even connect to their Macbooks, though it would charge. They offered me a new 4S for $199 (no contract extension) but I didn&#8217;t want to do that. Last week I took my phone to Best Buy and got $100 for it towards a new 5S. The 5S is great and IOS7 works fine on it, though it does still have quirks and bugs.</ins>
