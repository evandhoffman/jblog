I got my Wii in late 2006 and around 2009 I noticed it was starting to sound like a circular saw when the disc drive was spinning. This was annoying but it didn&#8217;t affect the games so I never thought much about it.

About two weeks ago, however, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BRZ9G0/?tag=evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BRZ9G0/?tag=evanhoffmasho-20', 'New Super Mario Bros. Wii']);" >New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a> stopped working:

The Wii basically worked except for the disc drive. As soon as I put a disc in, I&#8217;d get the error above &#8211; even if I didn&#8217;t start start the game. I tried blowing in the disc slot (the only thing I could think of&#8230; worked for my old NES!) but the problem continued. I figured I had two choices: buy another Wii or attempt to fix mine. Since mine was already essentially useless I figured it couldn&#8217;t hurt anything to try fixing it. 

After some searching I quickly learned that to do any work inside a Wii requires a Tri-Wing screwdriver just to open the case. I went to the hardware store and got a Tri-Wing bit but it was too big to be of any use on the Wii. I found this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018688GS/?tag=evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018688GS/?tag=evanhoffmasho-20', 'Silverwing Tri-Wing screwdriver']);" >Silverwing Tri-Wing screwdriver</a> on Amazon for under $5 that did the trick.

With trusty screwdriver in hand, I opened the Wii thusly:



With it now open I followed this guy&#8217;s advice:



Bending these small triangles down created a gap that stopped the vibration &#038; the noise and made the Wii playable again. <figure id="attachment_1066" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It has some new weird sounds when the disc first spins up and when it spins it down (I assume the braking mechanism) but it&#8217;s practically silent during gameplay. Yay!
