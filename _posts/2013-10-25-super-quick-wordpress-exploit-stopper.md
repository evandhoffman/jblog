I got an email yesterday from my host (DigitalOcean) that I was running a phishing website. So, I&#8217;m not, but I quickly guessed what happened: my WordPress got hacked. This is just one of the risks of running silly little PHP apps. I logged in, deleted the themes directories, reinstalled clean ones, and ensured this doesn&#8217;t happen again by doing the following:

  * useradd apache_ro
  * chown -R apache\_ro:apache\_ro $WP/wp-content/themes

Now apache can&#8217;t write to those directories. This means you can&#8217;t update WordPress via the web UI, but I&#8217;m ok with that.
