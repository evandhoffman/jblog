Having <a href="http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/?p=1390" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/?p=1390', 'migrated our DB to a new machine']);" >migrated our DB to a new machine</a>, I was left with a pretty good machine unused. I decided to rebuild it and try out Postgres 9.0.  
<!--more-->

  
I downloaded and installed CentOS 6.0 x86_64, built Postgres 9.0.4 from SRPMS (makes me feel better building it myself), installed it and did `initdb`, dumped the primary DB to our NAS using `psql` 9.0 (`pg_dump [db] | gzip > /path/to/file.gz`) and began the restore.

Not much of a story but it took 33 hours to restore the DB, with the bulk of the time spent building indices. When the restore was complete I did an `analyze verbose` which took another 2 hours, for a total of 35 hours, not counting the time it took to create the dump file &#8211; about 14 hours, but this was with the DB under heavy load, made heavier by the dump, so I don&#8217;t know how long it would really take. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t have to do this to migrate, but I&#8217;m not relishing the idea of doing a real upgrade to 9.0 if it&#8217;s going to take this long. For the restore I disabled autovacuum and set `fsync = off`. It&#8217;s an ext4 filesystem on a 24-disk RAID 10 of 10krpm SAS drives.

DB size on disk after a clean restore was 1156 GB, as per `pg_database_size()`, versus 1237 GB on disk for the one that was migrated via bit-copy, so there&#8217;s a sizable chunk of crud accumulated in there.

Also, in doing this I discovered the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/logger" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://linux.die.net/man/1/logger', 'logger']);" >logger</a> command. One of the things that I&#8217;ve always found annoying about doing a pg restore is that the output is just a bunch of statements like this:

<pre>SET
SET
SET
CREATE SCHEMA
ALTER SCHEMA
CREATE SCHEMA
ALTER SCHEMA
SET
CREATE TABLE
ALTER TABLE
CREATE FUNCTION
ALTER FUNCTION
</pre>

This is just what&#8217;s returned from the SQL commands, but it&#8217;s not very informative, and most importantly it doesn&#8217;t show you the timestamp so you have no idea how long anything&#8217;s taking. With `logger`, you can just pipe the output to it and it&#8217;ll be logged with syslog. So my restore command looked like this:

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">zcat</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>nfs<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>db<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>pgdump-<span style="color: #000000;">90</span>.sql.gz <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> psql <span style="color: #660033;">-Upguser</span> db <span style="color: #000000;">2</span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">&gt;</span> ~<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>restore.20110723-<span style="color: #000000;">1916</span>.log <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> logger <span style="color: #660033;">-t</span> PGRESTORE</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

This made it trivial to get the messages out of `/var/log/messages` with grep:

<pre>[root@link log]# grep PGRESTORE messages | head
Jul 24 03:36:43 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
Jul 24 03:36:43 link PGRESTORE: SET
Jul 24 03:36:44 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
Jul 24 03:36:44 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
Jul 24 03:38:45 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
Jul 24 03:39:13 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
Jul 24 03:39:13 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
Jul 24 03:39:13 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
Jul 24 03:39:13 link PGRESTORE: SET
Jul 24 03:39:13 link PGRESTORE: ALTER TABLE
</pre>

In addition to having the timestamps it eliminates the accumulation of the random log files that accumulate like droppings from myriad one-off scripts. I modified about 20 cron jobs to pipe their output to logger rather than junk files in /tmp or my homedir. I can&#8217;t believe I never heard of logger before! Hooray for logger!
