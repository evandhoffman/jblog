For a few years I&#8217;ve been funneling my various inboxes directly to my Gmail account. The massive storage, great web UI, and spam filtering made it a no-brainer. I&#8217;d basically been relying on a .forward file to do this until a couple of days ago when I signed up with Google Apps for evanhoffman.com, changed the MX records to point to Google, and &#8230; all my email still forwards to my Gmail account. But at least Bluehost is out of the loop now. Really, at this point the only reason for me to stay with them is the massive storage quota I have with them for the gallery; but even that doesn&#8217;t make much sense with the Picasa web albums stuff. They own Blogger so I assume I could port this whole thing over. Google&#8217;s free so I guess I&#8217;d save like $100 per year moving everything there, and I mostly only use it for email anyway. I think I&#8217;m paying like $8/month&#8230; With thin-provisioned disk space they could drop that to like $3/month probably and still make $.

Anyway, tomorrow&#8217;s the closing. I should go to bed. Oh, and WaMu is gone &#8211; attempting to login to the Wamu online banking redirects me to Chase.com now.
