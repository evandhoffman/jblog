It was pretty easy to copy and paste the old posts into here, and the ability to set the &#8220;publish&#8221; date was nice, I was afraid I&#8217;d have to go in and set the dates manually in the db.

I guess using WordPress makes me a hypocrite since I said I&#8217;d never have a &#8220;blog&#8221;, but when you manually edit HTML in vi, updates are rare. I think the only person who is going to read this is my mother, and that&#8217;s fine too.

The old page is still up <a href="http://www.evanhoffman.com/index.20090327.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.evanhoffman.com/index.20090327.php', 'here']);" >here</a>; going to www.evanhoffman.com now will 302 you to WordPress now.

I wonder if it will improve my search-engine rank to have this site in WordPress now&#8230; Time will tell!
