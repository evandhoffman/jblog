So we switched back to Cablevision and it went pretty well, but apparently Verizon users can&#8217;t call our house number (ported from Verizon to Cablevision). Verizon users have to call from their mobiles in order to complete the call. I&#8217;m guessing that Verizon hasn&#8217;t updated their systems to indicate that they no longer &#8220;own&#8221; our number and is trying to route the call inside their network. Sucks because I can&#8217;t imagine Verizon jumping to help fix this since I&#8217;m not their customer anymore.
