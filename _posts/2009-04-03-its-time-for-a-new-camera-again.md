My old Canon A540 has served me well but I feel it&#8217;s on its last legs. The flash timing seems off for indoor pictures, so the shot gets ruined &#8211; too dark but lots of glowing eyes. I&#8217;m a real newb with cameras, I like setting it on full auto and just letting it rip. It would be nice to know how to take fancy photos but I&#8217;d rather the camera do it for me, because I&#8217;m lazy.

Anyway, I&#8217;ve narrowed it down to two, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0015DPJ5W/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0015DPJ5W/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20', 'Canon SD770IS']);" >Canon SD770IS</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0012YC7AE/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0012YC7AE/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20', 'Canon SD1100IS']);" >Canon SD1100IS</a>. I&#8217;m leaning more toward the 770 now, it seems to be the better of the two, and only like $10 more.
