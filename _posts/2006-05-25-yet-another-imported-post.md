I&#8217;m not sure what camera to get. Currently I have the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=145&modelid=8288" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=145&modelid=8288', 'Canon PowerShot A40']);" >Canon PowerShot A40</a>, which I bought in like 2002-2003. It takes great pictures but in low light situations it is extremely slow &#8211; sometimes 5-10 seconds between pressing the shutter and the flash going off. It also takes 4 AA batteries, which makes the camera heavier and bulky. I borrowed my mom&#8217;s <a href="http://evanhoffman.com/amazon/product.php?asin=B0000C8VEK" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://evanhoffman.com/amazon/product.php?asin=B0000C8VEK', 'Canon  Digital Rebel']);" >Canon Digital Rebel</a> for a few weeks, and while it took awesome pictures and was really fast, it was just too big (and expensive) for me. As much of a nerd as I am, I really don&#8217;t have much interest in the art of photography and prefer something I can just whip out and point and shoot. So currently I&#8217;m looking at two cameras that seem to be pretty similar to each other: <a href="http://evanhoffman.com/amazon/product.php?asin=B000EMU888" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://evanhoffman.com/amazon/product.php?asin=B000EMU888', 'Canon PowerShot A530']);" >Canon PowerShot A530</a> and <a href="http://evanhoffman.com/amazon/product.php?asin=B000AYKV4G" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://evanhoffman.com/amazon/product.php?asin=B000AYKV4G', 'Canon PowerShot A610']);" >Canon PowerShot A610</a>. The 530 only requires 2 AA batteries and is around $50 cheaper than the 610, which takes 4 AAs. The biggest difference I could find was the size of the LCD (which I don&#8217;t care about) and the 610 appears to take higher res movie clips. Reviews My favorite camera review site, Steve&#8217;s Digicams, reviewed them both &#8211; <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2006_reviews/a530.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.steves-digicams.com/2006_reviews/a530.html', 'A530']);" >A530</a>, <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2005_reviews/a610.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.steves-digicams.com/2005_reviews/a610.html', 'A610']);" >A610</a>. I&#8217;ll have to think about it some more.
