Optimum Boost advertises 30 Mbps down, 5 Mbps up. Here&#8217;s a speed test I just ran at <a href="http://speedtest.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://speedtest.net/', 'Ookla&#8217;s SpeedTest.net']);" >Ookla&#8217;s SpeedTest.net</a>:

(My desktop is plugged into the router, the router is plugged into the Arris cablemodem.)

Here&#8217;s one of the last speed tests I did with Verizon, on 2/15. I had the 25/15 internet package:

(Desktop was plugged into 8-port Linksys 100 Mbit switch, the switch was plugged into the FiOS/ActionTec router.)

Verizon&#8217;s upload is much better than Cablevision&#8217;s, as you can see. Most people probably won&#8217;t notice it, but I do. Another thing to consider is that the FiOS router has pretty good WiFi built in. I got pretty good speeds using 802.11g on my laptop upstairs connected to the FiOS router downstairs. With Cablevision I went back to my old Netgear WGR614v7 router that I&#8217;d bought in 2009 after my trust Linksys WAP54G AP had died (at that point I was using my Linux box as router/NAT). The WGR614v7 is pretty crappy. The UI is fine and I guess for basic usage it&#8217;s acceptable, but the antenna is pretty small and the signal was very weak. When I connected 6-7 devices to it (Wii, 2 laptops, Mac Mini, 2 iPhones, Kindle) it would randomly not work on one of them. Rebooting the router fixed it, for a while. Somewhere in the logging facility of the router I saw an out-of-memory error. The kicker was that we&#8217;d get errors in the browser randomly when loading pages, and wifi speeds were pretty lousy &#8211; 10 Mbps down on the 30 Mbps Optimum connection.

I decided to right this wrong and spring for a new WiFi router. After some quick checking of Newegg I found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034CN0AS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=evanhoffmasho-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399349&#038;creativeASIN=B0034CN0AS" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034CN0AS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evanhoffmasho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B0034CN0AS', 'TP-LINK TL-WR841ND']);" >TP-LINK TL-WR841ND</a> 802.11n router for $25 with free shipping and a free 802.11n USB adapter (TL-WN727N). Seemed like a no-brainer. I got it, set it up in under 10 minutes, plugged the N adapter into my wife&#8217;s laptop and can easily max the 30 Mbps cable connection from upstairs now. My laptop is still using G and the speeds &#038; signal are pretty good. The TP-Link has 2 antennae and both are much larger than the Netgear&#8217;s single antenna; I can get a strong signal outside on my deck on the opposite side of the house from the router in the basement.
