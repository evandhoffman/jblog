The LOST finale was a decent episode against the backdrop of a terrible season. Really nothing got answered. The only way it could be not terrible is if everyone on the plane died when it crashed in the series pilot, but that doesn&#8217;t appear to be what happened. Oh well, at least it&#8217;s over.
