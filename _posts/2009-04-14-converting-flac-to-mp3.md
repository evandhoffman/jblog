I downloaded a couple of albums in FLAC format the other day and wanted to convert them to MP3.  I found a couple of ways to do this, with the most trivial seeming to be FLAC -> WAV and then WAV->MP3, since there are plenty of tools to do WAV -> MP3.  But, being lazy, I didn&#8217;t want to have to re-enter the ID3 info for each of the tracks.  After a couple of minutes of searching I found <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foobar2000.org/', 'foobar2000']);" >foobar2000</a> which has a nifty convert function. The included MP3 presets, however, were not to my liking. Namely they were both Joint Stereo. I know there&#8217;s some debate in audiophile circles about Joint Stereo and lots of people claim it&#8217;s fine, but I don&#8217;t like it, and if it&#8217;s a matter of a couple of extra kB in a file to ensure I don&#8217;t hear weird warbling then that&#8217;s a small price to pay. To setup my own preset I had to get an executable copy of LAME. CDex comes with LAME but it&#8217;s in a .dll which doesn&#8217;t work. Fortunately I found lame.exe on <a href="http://lame.buanzo.com.ar/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lame.buanzo.com.ar/', 'this Audacity download site']);" >this Audacity download site</a> and I was able to specify the command-line options to lame.exe to encode the tracks exactly how I wanted. So now, after having lost the discs (which I purchased) years ago, I again have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000006TRV/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000006TRV/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20', 'Electric Ladyland']);" >Electric Ladyland</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002P5U/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002P5U/ref=nosim/evanhoffmasho-20', 'The Wall']);" >The Wall</a>. Yay!
