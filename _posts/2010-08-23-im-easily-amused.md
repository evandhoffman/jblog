I don&#8217;t know why I find the visitor geo-tracking widgets so entertaining, but I do. I just found <a href="http://www.revolvermaps.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.revolvermaps.com/', 'Revolver Maps']);" >Revolver Maps</a> and added it on the right side. It&#8217;s Flash-based so it takes a while to load but it&#8217;s interesting to look at.
