I&#8217;m looking into training courses for Exchange 2010, and to add a course to &#8220;My Learning,&#8221; which I guess is the equivalent of a shopping cart, I had to sign in with my Live.com ID. I have a Live.com ID because you need one to see your MS licenses and download ISOs, etc. It&#8217;s not as seamless as Google&#8217;s ID but it seems to work ok most of the time. But here&#8217;s an instance where it sucks:

I&#8217;m already logged in, why do I need to input all my info again? Including my email address, which was required to login?
