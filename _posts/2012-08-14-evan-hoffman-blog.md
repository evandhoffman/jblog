I hate calling this site &#8220;Evan Hoffman&#8217;s Blog,&#8221; but it seems that when I Googled my own name most of the results were about <a href="http://newton.patch.com/articles/evan-hoffman-pleads-guilty-to-motor-vehicle-homicide-sentenced" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://newton.patch.com/articles/evan-hoffman-pleads-guilty-to-motor-vehicle-homicide-sentenced', 'this guy']);" >this guy</a>. So let me just clarify&#8230; that&#8217;s not me. I enjoyed having the title be obscure lyrics from songs I love but drastic times call for drastic measures. And let me tell you&#8230; renaming a blog is serious business.
