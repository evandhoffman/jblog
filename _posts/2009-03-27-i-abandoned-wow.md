WoW got boring so I let my subscription expire again. Rogue was an amazing class to play through Burning Crusade but with Lich King the game <a href="http://www.sk-gaming.com/arena/team/2/all/all/all/all/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sk-gaming.com/arena/team/2/all/all/all/all/', 'got pretty stupid']);" >got pretty stupid</a> and while Wintergrasp was awesome, it got boring too, so Khal is in mothballs again. I picked up my druid a bit but that got repetitive too &#8211; I&#8217;d just get to 80 and the same thing would happen.
