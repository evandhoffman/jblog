Well, this was unexpected. Verizon is really playing hardball with pricing. When I called this morning to cancel my install appointment, Verizon countered and they offered an extra $30/month discount. I asked for an extra STB for free (I figured all they can do is say no) and while the rep said she couldn&#8217;t do that, she did increase the credit to $40/month which would more than cover the cost of the 2nd box. So as of this moment, I&#8217;m on for FiOS tomorrow.

Ain&#8217;t competition great?
