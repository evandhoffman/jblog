About a year and a half ago we went shopping for a bed. We went to the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sleepy%27s+deer+park&#038;ll=40.762244,-73.313119&#038;spn=0.008094,0.021136&#038;oe=utf-8&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;fb=1&#038;gl=us&#038;hq=sleepy%27s&#038;hnear=0x89e82c34d2927743:0xd0ceb2e47226c7e0,Deer+Park,+NY&#038;cid=0,0,10828008647811799480&#038;t=m&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=A" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sleepy%27s+deer+park&ll=40.762244,-73.313119&spn=0.008094,0.021136&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&fb=1&gl=us&hq=sleepy%27s&hnear=0x89e82c34d2927743:0xd0ceb2e47226c7e0,Deer+Park,+NY&cid=0,0,10828008647811799480&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A', 'Sleepy&#8217;s in Deer Park']);" >Sleepy&#8217;s in Deer Park</a> and tried out a bunch of the beds. They had some computer where you lay on it and it recommends firmness, and we ended up getting a Kingsdown based partly on the recommendations of this computer (it was also a really comfy mattress). I forget the model of the bed but it had different firmness on my side and my wife&#8217;s, which seemed like a cool feature.

Fast-forward to now. The bed is no longer comfortable. It feels actually like sleeping on concrete. I&#8217;ve been sleeping on the couch (an Ikea Ektorp) because that&#8217;s actually less painful than the bed. And between the two sides of the bed is a solid piece of styrofoam, which with each side sagging has become sort of a mountain down the center of the bed.

So there&#8217;s some background info. In a moment of mild despair I asked this on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    Why is it so hard to find a comfortable bed?

My Internet buddy Jon Hayden responded, and we had a brief Twitter conversation about beds, both of us having purchased ours at Sleepy&#8217;s. (Twitter&#8217;s embedded tweet thing appears to include the original tweet in an @reply, so this looks like of strange.)

The bed we have (bought in 2011) was $4000, marked down to $1000, and I can&#8217;t stand it. Expensive mistake.

Being a cynical guy, here was my response:

Mattress pain?

Today&#8217;s 1/29 and I was planning to write an email to Sleepy&#8217;s to see what (if anything) they could do, but my phone rang and the caller ID came up &#8220;Sleepys LLC.&#8221; Uh oh&#8230; 

Well, I spoke to a rep from Sleepy&#8217;s and sure enough, she was calling in reference to my Tweet. She assured me that Sleepy&#8217;s is very concerned about customer satisfaction, apologized for the trouble, and said she would credit my **full purchase price** toward another mattress &#8211; and when I&#8217;ve picked one out at a showroom and am ready to purchase it, I should call her directly for discounted pricing. As I told her on the phone, I was STUNNED. At a high level I was pretty impressed they managed to call me based only on my Twitter name, but it IS my actual name, but I think that&#8217;s pretty resourceful of them. But on another level, WOW. I mean, that computer at Sleepy&#8217;s was part of the reason we bought the mattress, and of course the salesman wants to sell, but I&#8217;m a firm believer in caveat emptor &#8211; if you buy something and don&#8217;t like it, too bad. Plus it&#8217;s been almost two years since I bought it. This is really amazing. Assuming this really works out, I&#8217;ll be a Sleepy&#8217;s customer for life. Amazing!
