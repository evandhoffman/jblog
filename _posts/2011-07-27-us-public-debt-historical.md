In a recent &#8220;debate&#8221; with a friend, I looked for historical data about the US public debt. I found <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/overview?ds=z6tggkh2adod2s_" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/publicdata/overview?ds=z6tggkh2adod2s_', 'Google Public Data']);" >Google Public Data</a>, which has info about the annual budget deficit/surplus, but apparently (oddly) doesn&#8217;t have the debt. Odd because this info is available <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm', 'on the Treasury website']);" >on the Treasury website</a>.

I copied &#038; pasted the data into Google Docs and made <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Arz9JIGL5KjodGlHZjZyRE9YXzBRd0JpVDRKWkE1d0E&#038;hl=en_US" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Arz9JIGL5KjodGlHZjZyRE9YXzBRd0JpVDRKWkE1d0E&hl=en_US', 'a chart of my own']);" >a chart of my own</a> and some basic comparisons over time. Here are some of them rendered as images, though the scale makes the horizontal access kind of useless. I tried embedding the interactive Flash-based graph but it didn&#8217;t work. Oh well.
