Ran a ping test at pingtest.net today. Overall I can&#8217;t find fault with the FiOS service so far. Port 80 and 443 are open and I have them forwarded to my Linux box so I can actually run a webserver in my basement. I&#8217;m debating moving this domain over to my own linux box, since it&#8217;s super low traffic, but I probably won&#8217;t.

Only (minor) problems with FiOS are:

  * With FiOS Digital Voice there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a &#8220;distinctive ring&#8221; option, which I had found handy with Cablevision.</p> 
      * The 10-digit dialing is annoying. It&#8217;s nice not to have to dial the &#8220;1&#8221; before a long-distance number, but having to dial the 516 area code even for other 516 numbers is annoying. I know that&#8217;s how it is for everyone in NYC already though regardless of phone provider. </ul> 
        I&#8217;m waiting to see what my bill for month 2 will be. Lots of credits for month 1 so that will be extra low.
