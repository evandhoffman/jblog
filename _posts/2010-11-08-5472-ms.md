I signed up with <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pingdom.com/', 'Pingdom']);" >Pingdom</a> to monitor my website. They have a free service if you just want to monitor a single site, and since I only have one site, this is perfect. Since this server gets knocked offline all the time (thanks LIPA) I figured this was a prudent step. However, Pingdom also offers response time stats, and the stats are not good. Average response time is around 4200 ms, and with the first test taking 5,472 ms to respond.

Oh well. It&#8217;s free. Maybe I should move it to wordpress.com.

**Edit**: Pingdom is so smart. They have banners so you can advertise your awesome (?) uptime!
