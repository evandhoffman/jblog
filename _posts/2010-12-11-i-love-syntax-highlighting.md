It occurred to me that someone probably already solved the problem of WordPress&#8217;s crappy handling of pasted code in posts. I found <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/', 'WP-syntax']);" >WP-syntax</a> which does just that, so I&#8217;ve been going through and wrapping code chunks in the proper tags. The &#8220;<code>&#8221; tag is a total waste, and when I tried pasting in a chunk of XML in a recent post, everything looked like crap. So here&#8217;s to syntax highlighting.
