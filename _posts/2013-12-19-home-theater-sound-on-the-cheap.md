In 2009 I got my first HDTV, a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16889433002" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16889433002', 'Digital Lifestyles 42&#8243;']);" >Digital Lifestyles 42&#8243;</a> from NewEgg. The reviews were mixed but the common theme was that this screen had a great picture and terrible sound. I decided to take a chance, and if the sound was really that bad I&#8217;d figure something out.

Well, turned out the sound was, in fact, terrible. Not merely tinny, the speakers crackled and popped, and were essentially unusable. To my relief, the TV had a headphone jack on the side, so I got a set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002SQ0A4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0002SQ0A4&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002SQ0A4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002SQ0A4&linkCode=as2&tag=evanhoffmasho-20', 'Logitech X-230 computer speakers']);" >Logitech X-230 computer speakers</a>, plugged them into the headphone jack and the problem was solved &#8211; for a mere $35. The sound was really impressive for such a cheap setup and best of all the volume could still be controlled via the TV remote.

Fast forward to 2013. On Black Friday I took a trip to the local <a href="http://www.pcrichard.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pcrichard.com/', 'PC Richard']);" >PC Richard</a> and picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B59NX54/ref=as\_li\_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B00B59NX54&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=evanhoffmasho-20>Panasonic TC-L58E60</a> 58&#8243; for a good price. The TV is great but the built-in speakers are weak and unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t have a headphone jack, so I couldn&#8217;t hook the speakers up to it. What could I do?

I did some research and ended up buying this <a href=" onclick="\_gaq.push(['\_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B59NX54/ref=as\_li\_ss\_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B59NX54&linkCode=as2&tag=evanhoffmasho-20>Panasonic TC-L58E60</a> 58&#8243; for a good price.

It&#8217;s powered by USB and converts the optical signal to standard headphone output. For the power, I plug the USB cable directly into the TV, which is handy because then it gets powered on and off with the TV. Unfortunately with this setup the volume can&#8217;t be controlled via the TV remote any longer. I plan to get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3AKF1C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B00E3AKF1C&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3AKF1C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00E3AKF1C&linkCode=as2&tag=evanhoffmasho-20', '2.1 soundbar with wireless subwoofer']);" >2.1 soundbar with wireless subwoofer</a> eventually, but for now this mostly works. So if you&#8217;re looking to get pretty good sound your HDTV for relatively little cost, this might work for you.
