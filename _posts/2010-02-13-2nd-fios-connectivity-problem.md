This is the second time this has happened: All the wifi devices in my house lose their connection to the FiOS router/access point (ActionTec MI424WR-GEN2). I checked my wired desktop and it wasn&#8217;t able to get an IP from the DHCP server (the router). The &#8220;Internet&#8221; light on the router was out. I unplugged the router and plugged it back in and it came back up fine. But this happened about a month ago too &#8211; I wonder if it&#8217;s a monthly thing? Either way, it&#8217;s annoying. Other than this, the internet service is phenomenal still.
