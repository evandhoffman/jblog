The face tagging feature in Picasa 3.5 is really cool I don&#8217;t really have anything special to say about this. I just downloaded it and it&#8217;s only 15% done with my library but it&#8217;s really neat. <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://picasa.google.com/', 'Download it here']);" >Download it here</a> if you don&#8217;t have it.
