I was stuck somewhere the other day wishing I had the full movie &#8220;Cars&#8221; on my iPhone. Surprisingly, this is not something you can presently do through iTunes. After some searching I figured out an easy way to do it for free. The two programs you&#8217;ll need are good old <a href="http://www.mrbass.org/dvdrip/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mrbass.org/dvdrip/', 'DVD Decrypter']);" >DVD Decrypter</a> and <a href="http://winff.org/html_new/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://winff.org/html_new/', 'WinFF']);" >WinFF</a>. Put DVD Decryptor in IFO mode and set it not to split the .vob files by size (so it rips them to one huge 6+ GB .vob file). Then drag the .vob file onto WinFF (making sure to use the proper preset for iPhone/iPod) and click &#8220;Convert.&#8221; It&#8217;ll take a while but it works. With my first attempt there seem to be some audio/video sync issues but I&#8217;ll play around with it.

Also, see <a href="http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/2009/05/27/one-click-converting-avi-to-mp4-for-ipod-or-iphone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/2009/05/27/one-click-converting-avi-to-mp4-for-ipod-or-iphone/', 'this previous post']);" >this previous post</a> for more info about WinFF and iPhone-compatible video.
