We are currently looking at houses to purchase. We looked at one today that&#8217;s right on the water &#8211; the back yard abuts a canal. I am not extremely thrilled with this feature, as GPS records the elevation of the house as 0m above sea level. Supposedly it hasn&#8217;t flooded since hurricane Gloria. Hmm.

I completed my first experiment with Ruby on Rails and Ajax last night and it was pretty fun. They make a lot of stuff easy for you. I am enjoying it.

Anthony is sick, this is his 3rd day with a 100+ fever. The doctor said it may be Coxsackie virus. He seems fine but won&#8217;t sleep, and the fever was around 102 earlier today.

iPhone is still pretty cool. I still want to try making an iPhone app. Stupid Apple and their Mac-only SDK.
