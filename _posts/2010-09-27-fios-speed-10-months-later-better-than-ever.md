I <a href="http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/?p=264" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/?p=264', 'switched to FiOS']);" >switched to FiOS</a> in December, 2009, and I was pretty apprehensive, having been a Cablevision customer for many years. I really had no problem with Cablevision&#8217;s service, I just thought their pricing was much too high in the face of the new competition (and deals) Verizon was offering. I ended up going with Verizon due to their awesome deal, but now it&#8217;s almost a year later and I can&#8217;t imagine going back to Optimum. It&#8217;ll probably come down to price when the current promo pricing I have with Verizon ends, but if the price was equal then no contest &#8211; I&#8217;d stick with FiOS.
