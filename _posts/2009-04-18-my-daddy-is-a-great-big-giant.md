I can&#8217;t help but feel people will be underwhelmed when they finally meet me after this kind of a build up. I&#8217;m flattered though.

The fan in the bedroom burst into flames tonight and Anthony was terrified, so he got to spend the rest of the night downstairs while we watched TV.

I should be sleeping. I finished StarCraft Zerg mission 6 tonight. Now that I got the hang of the ctrl-groups it was pretty easy, I had an armada of 24 mutalisks, 12 guardians, and 12 hydralisks. I picked up StarCraft a couple of days after my WoW sub ran out and I haven&#8217;t missed WoW at all. I know 3.1 is out now but until I see some massive nerfs for DKs it&#8217;s not worth even considering going back, though as sick as it sounds, I do feel bad for my rogue. If you&#8217;ve never played an MMO you wouldn&#8217;t understand.

On another note, I guess this WordPress thing has worked out pretty well so far.
