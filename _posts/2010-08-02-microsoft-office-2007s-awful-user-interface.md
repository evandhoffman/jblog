Office 2007 is pretty old by now, and I know much has been written on the move from a &#8220;normal&#8221; looking app to the &#8220;Ribbon&#8221; UI. I personally hate the change and feel Microsoft just changed the UI as a way to make the application look &#8220;different&#8221; so that people will look at it and go &#8220;oooh, shiny!&#8221; and not feel as bad about being forced into another $400 upgrade of a word processor. Sure, Excel&#8217;s row limit was finally raised beyond 64k, and I&#8217;m sure there were some other tweaks, but .docx? .xlsx? Yet more file formats, ensuring most businesses will feel compelled to upgrade. If your clients are upgrading, you&#8217;re going to have to.

Anyway, that&#8217;s all well documented. What may not be is the ridiculous location of the SMTP header info in a message in Outlook. If you want to view this interserver communication, which is invaluable when debugging mail issues, you can either A) right-click the message in the inbox, or B) &#8230; Well, in Office 2003, there was a way to do this from within the open message. I didn&#8217;t think there was a way to do it from within the message in Outlook 2007, but it turns out there is. It&#8217;s just retarded:

WTF?

Dear Microsoft: please drop the &#8220;Ribbon&#8221; completely and go back to menus, or at least provide that as an option. This UI is awful.
