A few months ago I was on a quest to figure out how to change my Active Directory password via a browser (for Linux/Mac users). I <a href="http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/?p=321" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/?p=321', 'finally figured it out']);" >finally figured it out</a>, but since I&#8217;ve been working on this Exchange 2010 migration I noticed one of the features of OWA (Outlook Web App) in Exchange 2010 is that you can change the AD password right in the browser from within the app:

The new OWA has a zillion other awesome features, my favorite being that Firefox and Chrome are no longer second-class-citizens and can use the &#8220;full version&#8221; now, even on Linux. So anyway, I guess all my work was for nothing. Not the first time (or the last). <img src="http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
