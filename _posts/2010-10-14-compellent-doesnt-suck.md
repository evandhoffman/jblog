I noticed a bunch of people landing on this site by searching for &#8220;compellent sucks.&#8221; I just want to avoid any confusion: Compellent doesn&#8217;t suck. Now that the pain of spending the money to expand our Compellent SAN is in the past, I am back to being in love with the product. The only gripe I&#8217;ve really ever had with Compellent is the price, and as Ben Franklin said:

> The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten.
