I just found this <a href="http://php.democratandchronicle.com/RocDocs/sat/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://php.democratandchronicle.com/RocDocs/sat/', 'cool site']);" >cool site</a> which has SAT scores for high schools all over NYS, but for me the sorting didn&#8217;t work, so I copied the stuff into Excel and sorted by total score (and added the % columns). The data are supposedly from the NYS Department of Education for the 2007 graduating class. Found the link via <a href="http://www.city-data.com/forum/long-island/731713-accurate-l-i-high-school-rankings.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.city-data.com/forum/long-island/731713-accurate-l-i-high-school-rankings.html', 'the Long Island City-Data.com forums']);" >the Long Island City-Data.com forums</a>. Rather than trying to HTMLify the table and make it work inside WordPress, I just decided to print it to PDF, but the summary is below.
