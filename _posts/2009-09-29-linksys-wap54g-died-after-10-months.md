I bought my first wireless access point a few years ago &#8211; a Linksys WAP54G (v 1.0). It lasted 2-3 years. When it died I bought another WAP54G &#8211; version 3.1. This one just died tonight. I was sitting here and I noticed that the wireless was down. I moved the plug to another outlet and it came back up for about 20 minutes. It&#8217;s now completely dead. I bought this one on 12/3/08 from Amazon and it died on 9/28/09. What a piece of crap. Guess I&#8217;m done with Linksys now. For $65 it should last longer than 10 months.
