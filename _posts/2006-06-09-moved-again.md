Once again we have moved. I&#8217;m at the point where I think I&#8217;d buy a house just to not have to move again. What a nightmare. We got a 17 foot truck from Uhaul which came out to $159. We then ended up having to keep the truck for 2 extra days because we had SO MUCH SHIT so when I returned it it was another $130 in fees. Then $160 for a cleaning lady to clean the old house. But I&#8217;m glad to be out of that place, even if the new place isn&#8217;t perfect. But it has central air, and after suffering through last summer due to the old house&#8217;s lack of screened windows or windows capable of holding an air conditioner, central air is pretty close to perfection.
