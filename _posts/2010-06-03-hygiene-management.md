I&#8217;m installing Exchange 2010 and in the docs it shows a bunch of groups that get created in the AD Schema during the domain prep part. After running prep, I looked to see if the groups were there, and sure enough they were (yay). What caught my eye was that one of the groups is called **Hygiene Management**. I thought maybe this was an Easter Egg from MS, but <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd776125.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd776125.aspx', 'apparently']);" >apparently</a> it&#8217;s just the name of the group of people who can manage the Exchange antivirus/antispam features. Still funny though.
