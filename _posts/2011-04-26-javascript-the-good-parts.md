I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=evanhoffmasho-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399349&#038;creativeASIN=0596517742" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evanhoffmasho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0596517742', 'JavaScript: The Good Parts']);" >JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>, one of the best programming books I&#8217;ve read. The ending is fantastic:

> We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to consumers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use. We are finding that people like products that just work. It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to produce than designs that assemble long lists of features.
> 
> Features have a specification cost, a design cost, and a development cost. There is a testing cost and a reliability cost. The more features there are, the more likely one will develop problems or will interact badly with another. In software systems, there is a storage cost, which was becoming negligible, but in mobile applications is becoming significant again. There are ascending performance costs because Moore&#8217;s Law doesn&#8217;t apply to batteries.
> 
> Features have a documentation cost. Every feature adds pages to the manual, increasing training costs. Features that offer value to a minority of users impose a cost on all users. So, in designing products and programming languages, we want to get the core features—the good parts—right because that is where we create most of the value.
> 
> We all find the good parts in the products that we use. We value simplicity, and when simplicity isn&#8217;t offered to us, we make it ourselves. My microwave oven has tons of features, but the only ones I use are cook and the clock. And setting the clock is a struggle. We cope with the complexity of feature-driven design by finding and sticking with the good parts.

> It would be nice if products and programming languages were designed to have only good parts.
