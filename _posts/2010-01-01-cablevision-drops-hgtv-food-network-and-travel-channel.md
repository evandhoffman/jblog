Boy, good thing I left Cablevision when I did&#8230; HGTV is my wife&#8217;s favorite channel.

> In a separate case, the owner of the Food Network and HGTV, Scripps Networks, removed its channels from Cablevision’s lineups on Friday, a consequence of a breakdown in talks between those two parties.
> 
> “Viewers love our talent and our shows, which is why Food Network and HGTV rank among the top networks in cable,” Kenneth W. Lowe, the chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive, said in a statement Friday morning. “But our valuable networks simply are not being compensated like top 10 networks by Cablevision. The distribution rates Cablevision pays for Food and HGTV are among the lowest in the industry.”
> 
> The dispute may linger for some time; Cablevision said it had “no expectation of carrying their programming again, given the dramatic changes in their approach to working with distributors to reach television viewers.”
