My Bluehost renewal is coming up soon and I&#8217;m really debating cancelling it. It&#8217;s like $8/month, but with my email going directly to Gmail now, this dumb blog is the only thing of note at evanhoffman.com, and I can move that anywhere. I already copied all the content to another server but I can&#8217;t find free DNS hosting anywhere. Maybe i&#8217;ll just run my own nameserver.

MAYBE!!!
