I guess it&#8217;s not really a fair comparison since I&#8217;m running 32-bit Windows XP, but it strikes me as mildly retarded how much better my stupid $350 Mac Mini performs than my ~$1000 desktop. The Mac has a Core 2 Duo 1.83 GHz CPU with 1 gig ram and an 80 gig HD, running 10.5.6 (or something). My desktop is a 3.0 GHz Wolfdale with 4 gigs ram and a 1 TB 7200 RPM sata drive. The Mac isn&#8217;t super speedy but it seems more responsive in everything except iTunes, and that&#8217;s probably due to all the MP3s being served off my ancient Linux box (over G wireless). Actually, I still completely detest iTunes, and think Winamp is about the perfect MP3 player. But anyway, the stuff you can do &#8220;for free&#8221; on a Mac is pretty amazing. I haven&#8217;t played with iMovie or a bunch of the other programs yet, but even just Expose is pretty remarkable.

There&#8217;s a price tag for them, of course, but if my gaming days are over then I could probably get by with a ~$1200 Macbook or Macbook Pro, or probably even a higher end Mini with some more memory in it. I&#8217;m tempted at this point to try CentOS on the desktop just so I can have a 64-bit OS. Or maybe Windows 7. Maybe after the move.

Blehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
