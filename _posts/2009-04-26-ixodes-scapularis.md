I found a dog tick on myself yesterday. I actually felt it walking on my scalp. Good thing I had cut my hair. Then like a half hour ago I was scratching something on my right shoulder and when I looked at my hand I saw these little legs sticking out &#8212; what appeared to be a flea &#8212; but when I looked more closely I realized it was a very small tick. I don&#8217;t know if it was a deer tick or just a small dog tick, but it pissed me off anyway. We went upstairs to inspect Anthony (who was asleep) and I went over his head with a flashlight for about 5 minutes. We didn&#8217;t find anything but we&#8217;ll probably keep checking him for days.

The Great Outdoors indeed.
