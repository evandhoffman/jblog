I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009B50QOU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B009B50QOU&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=evanhoffmasho-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009B50QOU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009B50QOU&linkCode=as2&tag=evanhoffmasho-20', 'latest Green Day album']);" >latest Green Day album</a> for $5. After downloading and playing it I realized I was listening to a censored version of the album. I didn&#8217;t think there was much recourse since it was an MP3 download, and there&#8217;s no way to &#8220;return&#8221; it. But I figured it was worth a try anyway. The worst that could happen is they say no. I started a chat session and to my surprise, they refunded my purchase price within 5 minutes! That&#8217;s what I call service.

> You are now connected to Snow from Amazon.com.  
> Me:I didn&#8217;t realize the album I purchased was censored. The uncensored version is this one, which is the one I want instead: http://www.amazon.com/%C2%A1UNO-Explicit/dp/B009B50QOU/  
> Snow:Hi there, Evan ! My name is Snow, and I would be happy to help you with this issue.  
> This will take just a few moments to look into. <img src="http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  
> Me:Hello SNow  
> Snow:I am sorry about the confusion with that order,Evan . I have it refunded for you so you can get the version you had meant to. I also sent a confirmation of your refund to your email address associated with your Amazon account.  
> Me:Wow, that&#8217;s great. Thanks so much.  
> Snow:What that leaves now is just reordering from that link above.

> You are super welcome! I have gotten the wrong album on accident as well! It&#8217;s never good to hear Green Day censored. <img src="http://www.evanhoffman.com/evan/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  
> Me:Haha. It is such a great price too this week, $5 for the album. But when all the curses were bleeped out I was sad and realized I must have bought the wrong version.  
> Thanks again for your help!  
> Snow:You are very welcome ! I am glad I could help! Thank you for shopping with Amazon! 

I realize $5 is nothing to a company like Amazon, and a happy customer is worth a lot more than that, but this was still a great experience overall.
