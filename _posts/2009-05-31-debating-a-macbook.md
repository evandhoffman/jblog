I&#8217;m considering a MacBook. This is about 85% motivated by my desire to try writing an iPhone app, and apparently the SDK requires a Mac. I was thinking of a Mac mini but a laptop seems to have more utility.

I&#8217;ll have to think this over for several more weeks I guess.

Oh, and Starcraft Protoss mission 7 is quite annoying.
