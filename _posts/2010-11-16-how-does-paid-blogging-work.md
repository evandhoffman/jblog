I&#8217;ve been hearing for years about paid bloggers. If people are getting paid to write their crap down in an ad-supported industry, it seemed like it might make sense to throw some ads up on this very site to see what happens. I&#8217;ve had Adsense running on this site for a few months now and the short answer is a whole lot of nothing. Here&#8217;s what the earnings look like since 1/1/2009 (my Adsense account is much older than this site; I put the banner ads up around Fall of 2009):

<a href="http://evanhoffman.com/evan/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/adsense.png" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://evanhoffman.com/evan/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/adsense.png', '']);" ><img src="http://evanhoffman.com/evan/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/adsense.png" alt="" title="adsense" width="612" height="255" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932" /></a>

Basically, in a year I&#8217;ve &#8220;earned&#8221; under $20. That doesn&#8217;t even pay for domain registration &#038; DNS for a year. And since Google doesn&#8217;t actually pay you until you have $100 in earnings, this is fake money anyway.

Now I didn&#8217;t have any illusions about making money from this site, I just put the ads up as an experiment to see if this is a realistic way to earn a dependable income. From what I can tell, it can be, but only in certain cases, basically coming down to how much traffic you can generate.

  1. **You&#8217;re already famous**. If you&#8217;re already a &#8220;celebrity&#8221; in your field (whatever that field is) then people already probably want to hear what you say.
  2. **Your subject matter has mass appeal**. If you write about discoveries in quantum physics, you may have a decent following, but it&#8217;s still only going to be the people who care about quantum physics. If you write about Jersey Shore you have a much larger pool of possible readers, because everybody loves watching a train wreck.
  3. **What you say actually matters**. This is related to the first point. If Joe Shmoe (or Evan Hoffman) rants at the top of his lungs, it&#8217;s just some guy complaining. If Ben Bernanke makes an offhand comment about interest rates the stock market tanks.

I&#8217;m sure there are some other cases, but as far as I can tell a tech guy writing about things that annoy him doesn&#8217;t fit any of these criteria. I&#8217;m tempted to remove the ads altogether, but it&#8217;s too interesting seeing what ads Google puts up on some of these pages. The first few months, the ads were all for some rabbi&#8217;s circumcision service. Not sure what that was about.
